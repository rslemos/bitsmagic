/**
 * This class consists exclusively of static methods that implement a barrel 
 * shifter over arrays of integral primitive types.
 * 
 * &lt;p&gt;For every method available in this class, the arguments that represent
 * offsets should always be given in bits, and are 0-based. For more 
 * information about bit mapping in arrays of integral primitive types see 
 * {@link Store} class.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;The operations implemented in this class try to mimic Java shift 
 * operators: the shift amount is always taken modulo shift region width.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;Offlimits bits are hardwired to 0: when shifted in they appear as 0; 
 * when shifted out they are simply discarded. Methods in this class should 
 * never throw {@code ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException}.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;{@code NullPointerException} is thrown if the given array is {@code null}.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;All methods are inherently thread unsafe: in case of more than one thread 
 * acting upon the same storage the results are undefined. Also neither they 
 * acquire nor block on any monitor. Any necessary synchronization should be 
 * done externally.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
