# bitsmagic

Code library for simple (yet magic) bit manipulation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project is permanently under development using this [successful branching
model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

The "master" branch contains only released versions (currently none).

All development occurs in the "develop" branch.

Features are developed on "feature/\*" branches. On these branches the ["Only
the Gods" k≈çan](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2013/04/git-koans/#only-the-gods)
maybe regularly violated, as pushed commits can be rebased at will (these
branches should be temporary anyway).
